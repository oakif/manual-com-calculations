# Manual Center-of-Mass (COM) Calculations

Perform manual center-of-mass (COM) calculations in Python for converting molecles to smaller CG molecules. Follow the instructions in the Python notebook to get started. Output is pdb file syntax. Changes may be necessary to CG any molecule other than the *PEG-P(Asp(Bzl))* polymer.
